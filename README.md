_The Great Wave off Kanagawa_ is a two-player local wave making and fighting game, made during [2017 Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/great-wave-kanagawa). In this game, two players stand on opposite sides of the screen, trying to push the other off the screen by creating great wave as much as possible.
